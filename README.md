Practice Exercises in C++

## Levels
Each exercise level will increase in complexity/difficulty to allow for building on the core concepts.
Do not expect mindblowing revelations here. This is simply for me (re-)learning modern C++. 
The cool stuff will come later!

## Running
To see these babies run, navigate to the exercise folder of choice and utilize the compiler to build the executable.

Like so (in `Level1` directory):
```
g++ exercise3.cpp -o exercise3
```

Run the executable according to your OS:
```
./exercise3
```
_or_
```
exercise3.exe
```
_or_
```
exercise3
```
